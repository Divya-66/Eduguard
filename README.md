##  ðŸ› Git Collaboration Workflow

We use a **single main branch** as the source of truth.  
Follow these steps to contribute effectively.

###  Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/anshikkumartiwari/welldoc.git
cd welldoc


###  Sync with main Before Branching

git checkout main
git pull origin main


###  Create and Switch to a New Branch

git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

> Use descriptive branch names, e.g., feature/login-page or fix/api-timeout.

###  Work, Stage, and Commit

git add .
git commit -m "Describe your changes clearly"


###  Push Your Branch to Remote

git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name


###  Resetting a Branch to Remote State

git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/feature/your-feature-name

âš  *Warning:* This deletes uncommitted changes.  
If you want to keep them:

git stash
# Restore later
git stash pop


###  Merging a Branch into main

git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge feature/your-feature-name
git push origin main


###  Keeping Your Branch Updated with main

git checkout feature/your-feature-name
git pull origin main --rebase


###  Creating a Pull Request (PR)
1. Push your branch to GitHub.
2. Go to the repository page â†’ *"Compare & pull request"*.
3. Add a clear title and description.
4. Assign reviewers.
5. Submit PR.
6. Once approved, merge via GitHub UI or CLI.
